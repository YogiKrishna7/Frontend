2) npm install react

3) npm install react-dom

4) npm init

5) npx parcel index.html (to run the App)

6) npx parcel build index.html (in some cases, we have to remove the key "main" from json file, mainly when you are developing a module/library)

7) npx http-server dist (to serve the production app locally)

8)Optional: 
Add Scripts to package.json (Optional): To simplify these commands, you can add them as scripts in your package.json:
"scripts": {
  "start": "parcel index.html",
  "build": "parcel build index.html",
  "serve": "http-server dist" (Optional)
}

we can run the script, by using the key like start:
npm run start / npm run start / npm run serve etc.

9) To view on mobile etc via a QRcode:
Generate a QR Code for Easy Mobile Access (Optional): If you'd like to open the app on your phone without typing the URL:
